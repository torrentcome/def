The technique was originally used to avoid the need to assign a new address to every host when a network was moved, or when the upstream Internet service provider was replaced, but could not route the networks address space. It has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion.

Schema Layer Name Description 7 Application The top layer (apart from layer 8, the user) is responsible for a wide area. Some examples are resource sharing, remote file access, remote printer access and e-mail amongst other. Protocols using layer 7 includes FTP, DNS, and HTTP. 6 Presentation This layer is responsible for character code translation such as ASCII, Unicode, and EBCDIC. TLS and SSL protocols operate at this level. 5 Session Layer 5 is responsible for session establishment, termination and maintenance of sessions. Here we find the NetBIOS protocol and L2TP tunneling protocol. 4 Transport This layer is responsible for traffic control, session-multiplexing and segmenting messages. Two commonly used protocols are TCP and UDP. 3 Network The network layer is responsible for routing network packages. The layer provides traffic control, local addressing, and fragmentation. The most used protocol is IP, ICMP, and IGMP 2 Data Link This layer is responsible for link establishment, acknowledgment, error-checking to name a few.
