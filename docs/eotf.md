# EOTF
## Eotf = Electro-Optical Transfer Function

This is a term used in HDR (opens in new tab)(high dynamic range) displays to describe the action of converting data to a particular brightness on the screen. 

The EOTF is the mathematical function for transferring an electronic signal into the desired optical signal (i.e. digital to analog function). 

This differs from gamma (opens in new tab) in that gamma tells a display to emit a certain percentage of its max brightness, while EOTF tells it how many nits of brightness to produce.
