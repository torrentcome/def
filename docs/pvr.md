## PVR = Personal video recorder or Digital Video Recorder

It's an electronic device that records video in a digital format to a USB flash drive, SD memory card, SSD or other local or networked mass storage device. 

The term includes set-top boxes with direct to disk recording, portable media players and TV gateways with recording capability, and digital camcorders.

 Personal computers are often connected to video capture devices and used as DVRs; in such cases the application software used to record video is an integral part of the DVR. Many DVRs are classified as consumer electronic devices; such devices may alternatively be referred to as personal video recorders (PVRs), particularly in Canada.
 
Similar small devices with built-in (~5 inch diagonal) displays and SSD support may be used for professional film or video production, as these recorders often do not have the limitations that built-in recorders in cameras have, offering wider codec support, the removal of recording time limitations and higher bitrates.
