## OTT = Over-the-top media service

An over-the-top (OTT) media service is a streaming media service offered directly to viewers via the Internet. OTT bypasses cable, broadcast, and satellite television platforms, the companies that traditionally act as a controller or distributor of such content.[1] It has also been used to describe no-carrier cellphones, where all communications are charged as data,[2] avoiding monopolistic competition, or apps for phones that transmit data in this manner, including both those that replace other call methods[3][4] and those that update software.[4][5]

The term is most synonymous with subscription-based video-on-demand (SVoD) services that offer access to film and television content (including existing series acquired from other producers, as well as original content produced specifically for the service).

## Types of content

### OTT television
- OTT television, usually called online television or internet television or streaming television, remains the most popular OTT content.
### OTT messaging

- OTT messaging is defined as instant messaging services or online chat provided by third parties, as an alternative to text messaging services provided by a mobile network operator. An example is the Facebook-owned mobile application WhatsApp, that serves to replace text messaging on Internet connected smartphones. Other providers of OTT messaging include Viber, WeChat, FaceTime, Skype, Telegram and the now defunct Google Allo.

### OTT voice calling
- OTT voice calling, usually called VoIP, capabilities, for instance, as provided by Skype, WeChat, Viber, and WhatsApp use open internet communication protocols to replace and sometimes enhance existing operator controlled services offered by mobile phone operators

## IPTV = Internet Protocol TV
Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is the delivery of television content over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. 
This is in contrast to delivery through traditional terrestrial, satellite, and cable television formats. 
Unlike downloaded media, IPTV offers the ability to stream the source media continuously. 
As a result, a client media player can begin playing the content (such as a TV channel) almost immediately. 
This is known as streaming media. 

### IPTV / OTT
### OTT
In OTT, the video streaming uses the publicly accessible Internet connection. Thus it can be picked up externally. The content transmission is from a third party sectors like Netflix and YouTube.
Pros:

   * Price: Monthly prices as lows as $5, with much free content on YouTube and Hulu.
   * Installation: All you need is a laptop or phone. (Having a streaming TV box like the Roku or Apple TV enhances the experience, though.)
   * Programming: Wide choice of providers, with Netflix and others now offering original programming similar to cable.

Cons:

    * Quality: Subject to Internet speed, with “buffering” and other wait-times common for slow connections and peak-hour viewing.
    * Programming: While most shows can be found via major streaming services, some are cable-only and they generally don’t reach OTT streaming until the end of the season.
    *Data caps: Many ISPs now have limits on how much data you can consume, putting a limit on how much you can watch each month, even with unlimited plans
### IPTV
 IP stands for Internet Protocol, the “language” used to transfer packets of data between computers attached to the Internet network. IPTV is a platform where videos are used as per protocol streaming. This makes it a private managed content delivery network.

Pros:

   * Quality: High-quality video with fewer interruptions than OTT streaming due to privately managed content delivery network.
   * Programming: View-on-demand and get shows date of release.
   * Installation: Requires no special installation aside from a set-top box, assuming you already have broadband Internet.

Cons:

   * Price: Sold as a subscription at comparable rates to cable TV.
   * Quality: Since it comes over the Internet, it can get slowed down during peak hours.

IPTV services can be classified into three main groups:

   * Live television: With or without interactivity related to the current TV show.
   * Time-shifted television: Catch-up TV (replays a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago), Start-over TV (replays the current TV show from its beginning)
   * Video on demand (VOD): Browse a catalog of videos, not related to TV programming.
