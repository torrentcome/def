## GTVS = Google TV Services 

Basically an ANDROID TV FOR OPERATORS 
In a world where online video streaming via mobile is on the up-and-up, and both manufacturers and developers are responding to the popularity surge by bringing mobile devices in line, with larger screens and faster streaming capability, the news from the street is delivering a short, but relevant reminder that TV is being eyed by Google.

The news comes in the form of industry rumours that Alphabet, a collection of companies, the largest of which is Google, is about to rename Google Mobile Service (GMS), its mobile apps and API platform, to Google TV Services (GTVS), which would imply that the company’s focus is not going to be solely mobile in the future.
